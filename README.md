# The API

This project will be a new project based on the lessons I have learned in my
[fastapi-template](https://github.com/seapagan/fastapi-template) project.

It will be built from the ground up as an installable package which will give
you a solid foundation for building your own FastAPI projects, containing the
features from the template project including auth, user management, async
database access, a useful CLI and more. Docker integration will be included as
standard.

At moment I am still in the planning stages, but have put this out in public to
save the name, and document my intentions, there is no usable code here yet.

There is a package available on PyPI (`the-api`) which is a placeholder for now,
but will develop into the tool I couldn't have written a couple of years ago.
